My Custom Overlayed-Register Processor

A CPU with 128 bytes of internal registers that are overlayed for access as
8, 16, 32, 64, and 128 bit values.

This repo holds documents that I wrote years ago when toying with the long-time idea 
of designing my own CPU. I am not an electrical engineer or computer engineer, but
I have a long history of programming various CPUs, especially 8, 16, and 32 bit ones.

My original intent was to turn the design into something functional by writing the VHDL
code for it. I spent some free time writing a VGA (screen and character) driver in VHDL,
but ran out of time prior to working on the CPU itself.

I did manage to write a simple assembler, which is available on a web page.

The main web page describing the CPU is found in "WebPages/index.html".
